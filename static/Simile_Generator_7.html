    <h1>Your Own Version</h1>
    <p>Now that you know how to make a simile generator, let's make some similes of your own!</p>
    <p>Get out a sheet of paper and write 4 similes. Remember that a simile compares two things for emphasis. Those two things are connected by a phrase. For this project, all your similes should have the same connecting phrase. The phrase could be "like", "as", "am like", "is like", "are like", "is as", "am as", "are as", "as though", or "as if". Once you decide what your connecting phrase will be, write your own simile formula.</p>
    <p>Having a hard time coming up with similes? Think of people and experiences you have everyday. What are some things in nature, for instance, that remind you of those people and experiences? Maybe your best friend always seems cheerful. You could say, "My best friend is like the sunshine."</p>
    <p>Once you have 4 similes, write some <strong>pseudocode</strong>. Pseudocode is "fake code" that we write before we start writing real code. It helps us to get down our ideas and is similar to brainstorming. In your pseudocode, write down how you will divide each simile into two parts minus the connecting phrase. The connecting phrase is going to stand by itself, just like it did in the simile generator we just made.</p>

    <p>Then, write your code in the code editor below. Here is the basic format:</p>
    <p><code><strong>import random</strong></code></p>
    <p><code><strong>List_1 = ["", "", "", ""]</strong></code></p>
    <p><code><strong>List_2 = ["", "", "", ""]</strong></code></p>
    <p><code><strong>part_1 = random.choice(List_1)</strong></code></p>
    <p><code><strong>part_2 = random.choice(List_2)</strong></code></p>
    <p><code><strong>simile = part_1 + " (your connecting phrase here) " + part_2</strong></code></p>
    <p><code><strong>print(simile)</strong></code></p>

    <p>Once you have written your code, click <strong>Run</strong> as many times as you want to see different similes! Click <a href="Simile_Generator_8.html"><strong>Next</strong></a> when you're ready to try a new project.</p>
