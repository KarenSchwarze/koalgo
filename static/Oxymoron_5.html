        <h1>Writing the Code</h1>
        <p>Now that you've learned about indexing in Python, you're ready to write some more code for our oxymoron machine. By now you should have two variables--a list of adjectives and a list of nouns. Now we need to teach our program our oxymoron formula:</p>
        <p>oxymoron = adjective + noun</p>
        <p>If you think that the formula above kind of looks like a variable followed by values, you're on the right track! We use the = to <em>instantiate</em>, or add values to, a variable. We call the = the <em>assignment operator</em>. It can help to think of it as an equals sign.</p>
        <p>On line 3 of our code editor, we need to type the name of our new variable, <code><strong>oxymoron</strong></code>. If we want our oxymoron to be "equal to" the first word in our list of adjectives plus the first word in our list of nouns, what might we need to write as the value of that variable? In other words, what do we need to put on the right side of the equals sign?</p>
        <p>If you guessed something like <code><strong>oxymoron = adjectives[0] + nouns[0]</strong></code>, you're right!</p>
        <p>Before we try out our code, there's one more thing we need to add. If we type in our code just as it is above, the program with put the words "brawling" and "love" right next to each other, without any space between the words. Because we want a space between the words, we can add one by adding quotation marks with a single space in the middle, like this:</p>
        <p><code><strong>oxymoron = adjectives[0] + " " + nouns[0]</strong></code></p>
        Go ahead and type this code in the editor below on line 4. Then click <a href="Oxymoron_6.html"><strong>Next</strong></a> to continue.
