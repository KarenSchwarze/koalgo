        <h1>Your Own Version</h1>
        <p>Now that you know how to use the <code><strong>random</strong></code> module, how to make variables and values, and how to concatenate, it's time for your to make your own Couplet Creator.</p>
        <p><strong>Mapping It Out</strong></p>
        <p>Before we write our code in the code editor, it's a good idea to write down our ideas on a piece of paper. That way when we come back to our code editor, we'll have a better idea of what to write.</p>
        <p>1. First, we need to find a couplet that we can "revise". Shakespeare wrote a lot of couplets, so you can choose something from one of his plays or poems. You can also search online to find a great couplet.</p>
        <p>2. Write down your couplet on your piece of paper, and circle the last words in the lines.</p>
        <p>3. Make two lists of words that all rhyme with the last words of the couplet. We want each line to have its own list so that the program does not put the same word at the end of both lines of the couplet.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Writing the Code</strong></p>
        <p>Come back to the code editor below. The first thing we need to do is import the <code><strong>random</strong></code>module. On line 1, type <code><strong>import random</strong></code>. On lines 3 and 4, write the variables and values for your two lists of words. The format for this is <code><strong>line_1_rhyming_words = ["","","",]</strong></code> and <code><strong>line_2_rhyming_words = ["","",""]</strong></code>with one of your rhyming words within each pair of quotation marks.</p>
        <p>On lines 6 and 7, we need to get the user input for each line. Write this code in your editor below:</p>
        <p><code><strong>line_1 = input("Please type the first line of the couplet from the Prologue in Romeo and Juliet, minus the last word. ")</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>line_2 = input("Please type the second line of the couplet from the Prologue in Romeo and Juliet, minus the last word. ")</strong></code></p>
        <p>On lines 9 and 10, we need to teach our program the formula for each lines. Write this code in your editor:</p>
        <p><code><strong>line_1_final = line_1 + " " + random.choice(line_1_rhyming_words)</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>line_2_final = line_2 + " " + random.choice(line_2_rhyming_words)</strong></code></p>
        <p>On lines 12 and 13, we need to tell the program to print lines 1 and 2 of our new couplet. Write this code in your editor:</p>
        <p><code><strong>print(line_1_final)</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>print(line_2_final)</strong></code></p>
        <p>You're done writing your program! Now you just need to click <strong>Run</strong> as many times as you want to see your couplets. Then click <a href="Couplet_7.html"><strong>Next</strong></a> to continue.</p>
