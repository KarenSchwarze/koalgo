        <h1>More Oxymorons, Please!</h1>
        <p>Now that you know how to display the first oxymoron in our list--"brawling love"--it's time to do the same for the other oxymorons.</p>
        <p>To do this, go back to line 4. We're going to make some changes in this line and on the next few lines. You can move the<code><strong>print(oxymoron)</strong></code> code to the bottom of your code editor for now.</p>
        <p>Instead of having just one oxymoron variable, we're going to have four. That means we need to change our variable name on line 3 just slightly. Let's use <code><strong>oxymoron_1</strong></code>, as it's going to be the first of four oxymorons.</p>
        <p>Move on to line 4. Now we need to write the code for our second oxymoron. Any guess as to what the code will be?</p>
        <p>If you guessed <code><strong>oxymoron_2 = adjectives[1] + " " + nouns[1]</strong></code>, you're right! Now write the code for <code><strong>oxymoron_3</strong></code> and <code><strong>oxymoron_4</strong></code>. You should have a line of code for each oxymoron. The code for your oxymorons should take up lines 3 through 6. Once you're finished writing this code, click <a href="Oxymoron_8.html"><strong>Next</strong></a>.</p>
