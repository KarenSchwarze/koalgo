        <h1>Oxymoron</h1>
        <p>An <strong>oxymoron</strong>, a literary device, is a pair of words that are opposites. You can use them in your creative writing to add emphasis to a point you want to make. Here is an example:</p>
       <p><em>Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate...</em></p>
        <p><em>O heavy lightness, serious vanity...</em></p>
        <p><em>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health...</em></p>
        <p>-Romeo in <em>Romeo annd Juliet</em> by William Shakespeare, Act 1, lines 179, 181, 183</p>
        <p>Do you see the pairs of opposites in the lines above? Each of those pairs is an oxymoron.</p>
        <p>The character Romeo in the play <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> uses these opposites to describe the paradoxical nature of the kind of love he experiences. Perhaps one of the most famous oxymorons also comes from <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> when Juliet says that "Parting is such sweet sorrow", meaning that even though parting (saying goodbye) is sad, there is a sweet feeling in the experience as well.</p>
        <p>Think of some of your own examples of oxymorons. Are you a "cheerful pessimist"? Or have you ever watched a TV show about zombies, who are the "living dead"?</p>
        <p>Next, you'll make a Python program that creates oxymorons!</p>
