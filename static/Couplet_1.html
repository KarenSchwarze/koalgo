        <h1>The Couplet</h1>
        <p>"The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend."</p>
        <p>"To know our farther pleasure in this case,<br>
        To old Freetown, our common judgement place."</p>
        <p>"Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;<br>
          Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes..."</p>
        <p>What do all of the above have in common? They're couplets! A <strong>couplet</strong> is a literary device used in poetry. It consists of two lines, and the last words of the lines rhyme. Couplets can be found in poetry or, in a play, as part of a character's speech. William Shakespeare is one of the most famous writers to use couplets--all of the couplets above are from his play <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>.</p>
        <p>We're going to use a couplet from <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, plus some other words, to make a "couplet creator" program. Here's how the program works: Our program will ask the user for the first line of a couplet. The user will need to enter the first line of the couplet found at the end of the Prologue of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> minus the last word. So, the user will enter "The which if you with patient ears", because we are leaving off the last word in the line, which is "attend".</p>
        <p>Next, after hitting Enter, the user will need to enter the second line of the couplet (the last line of the Prologue), minus the last word. So, the user will enter "What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to", because we are leaving off the last word in the line, which is "mend". After the user types in this information and hits Enter, the program will randomly assign a word from a list we gave it to the end of each line, giving the user a new version of the couplet from the Prologue.</p>
        <p>Hit the <strong>Run</strong> button below to see how this code works. You'll enter your responses on the right side, in the "output" area. For your first answer, type: "The which if you with patient ears". Then hit Enter. For the second answer, type: "What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to". Then hit Enter. You will see a new version of the couplet. Because the original last words, "attend" and "mend", are part of the list of words the program can choose from, there is a chance that you will see these original words in the new version.</p>
        <p>Next, you'll learn how to make this program yourself! Click <a href="Couplet_2.html"><strong>Next</strong></a> to continue.</p>
