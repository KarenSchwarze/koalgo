        <h1>Making Noun Lists</h1>
        <p>We already know what nouns we're using for our metaphors. Now we need to split them up into two lists of nouns. Our first list will include the words "Juliet", "Dying", "All the world". Our second list will include the words "the Sun", "a wild night", "a stage". A connecting word will join the words in our noun lists to form metaphors. That word is "is". Let's start by splitting up our nouns into variables and values. Think of a <strong>variable</strong> as a box, and a <strong>value</strong> that goes into the box. Variables go on the left side of the = sign (called an "assignment operator"), and values go on the right side.</p>
        <p>For each metaphor, we need to have two variables--noun 1 and noun 2. Because we have 3 metaphors in total, we're going to make, or declare, a total of 6 variables: noun 1a and noun 1b, noun 2a and noun 2b, and noun 3a and noun 3b. That way, all 3 of our metaphors will have two nouns.</p>
        <p>Write the following code on lines 1 through 6 in your code editor below:</p>
        <p><code><strong>noun_1a = "Juliet"</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>noun_2a = "Dying"</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>noun_3a = "All the world"</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>noun_1b = "the Sun"</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>noun_2b = "a wild night"</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>noun_3b = "a stage"</strong></code></p>
        <p>Note that our variable names are always lowercase in Python and use underscores. Our values in this case are <strong>strings</strong>, which means that we need to have "" around them.</p>
