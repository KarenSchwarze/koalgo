        <h1>Metaphor Maker</h1>
        <p>"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women in it merely players." -William Shakespeare</p>
        <p>"Dying is a wild night and a new road." -Emily Dickinson</p>
        <p>"But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!" -William Shakespeare</p>
        <p>All of the examples above are metaphors. A <strong>metaphor</strong> is a literary device used for dramatic empahsis. There are different ways to structure a metaphor, but perhaps the simplest way is by using a conjugation of "to be" (am/are/is): "All the [world <em>is</em>] a stage...", "Dying <em>is</em> a wild night...", "Juliet <em>is</em> the sun!". When we use this metaphor structure, we generally follow this formula:</p>
        <p>metaphor = first noun + "to be" conjugation" + second noun</p>
        <p>We're going to use this formula to create a Metaphor Maker program using the metaphors above. Then you will make your own version of the program using your own metaphors!</p>
