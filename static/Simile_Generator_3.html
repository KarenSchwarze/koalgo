    <h1>Similes are Comparisons</h1>
    <p>A <strong>simile</strong> is a comparison of two things. To make our simile generator, we need to have two lists of things that we can compare. On lines 3 and 4, we are going to write two lists.</p>
    <p>Our first list is going to be called simply <code><strong>List_1</strong></code>. We're going to take the first part of the similes we showed you earlier and put them in this list. Write the following on line 3 of your code editor (on the left):</p>
    <p><code><strong>List_1 = ["The horse was strutting","There is no frigate","What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up","Character is"]</strong></code></p>
    <p>Note that <code><strong>List_1</strong></code> is called a <strong>variable</strong>, and each of the items in the list are called <strong>values</strong>. Think of a variable as a box, and the values as items in the box.</p>
    <p>Let's make another list on line 4:</p>
    <p><code><strong>List_2 = ["a prizefighter","a book","a raisin in the sun","a tree and reputation its shadow"]</strong></code></p>
    <p>Now we have two lists of phrases that are going to make up our similes. Click <a href="Simile_Generator_4.html"><strong>Next</strong></a> to continue.</p>
