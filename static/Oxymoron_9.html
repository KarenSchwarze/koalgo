        <h1>Your Own Version</h1>
        <p>You've just finished your oxymoron machine. Now it's time to take what you've learned and use it to create your own version of this project!</p>
        <p><p>Get out a sheet of paper. On your paper, write four oxymorons. Remember that each oxymoron contains an adjective and a noun. An adjective is a word that describes a noun. A noun is a person, place, or thing. The type of adjectives and nouns we use matters: The nouns should be the opposites of the adjectives, just as "brawling" is the opposite of "love" and "loving" is the opposite of "hate".</p>

        <p>Once you have four oxymorons, come back to the code editor below and write them as variables and values. Your first two lines of code should look like this, with a word inside each set of quotation marks:</p>

        <p><code><strong>adjectives = ["","","",""]</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>nouns = ["","","",""]</strong></code></p></p>

        <p>On lines 3-6, write the code for your oxymorons. Here's a hint, and see if you can remember how to do the rest!</p>
        <p><code><strong>oxymoron_1 = </strong></code></p>

        <p>Then write the code to display your oxymorons using <code><strong>print</strong></code>. Remember that there are two ways to display your oxymorons. You can either show them as a stack or as a list separated by commas. Here's the first one to get you started:</p>
        <p><code><strong>print(oxymoron_1)</strong></code></p>
        <p>When you have finished writing the code, click <strong>Run</strong> to see your oxymorons in the output area on the right!</p>

        <p>Then click <a href = "Oxymoron_10.html"><strong>Next</strong></a> to continue.</p>
