  <h1>Simile Formula</h1>
  <p>In English, we sometimes have formulas that we can use to construct language. A basic simile follows this formula:</p>
  <p><strong>simile = [thing 1] + "is/are/am" + "like/as" + [thing 2]</strong></p>
  <p>We're going to teach our program a version of this formula.</p>
	<p>On line 9 of your code editor, write this code:</p>
  <p><code><strong>simile = part_1 + " like " + part_2.</strong></code></p>
  <p>To keep things simple, for now we are just using "like", which is one of the possible connection phrases between [thing 1] and [thing 2] in a simile. Other possible connection phrases include like "as", "as though", "as if", "are like", "is like", "is as", and others.</p>
  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure to have a space before and after the word <em>like</em>, within the quotation marks, as shown above. Otherwise the words in your simile will be pushed up against each other!</p>
  <p>Now we need to tell our program to show our simile in the output area to the right of your editor below. To do this, we can use a <code><strong>print</strong></code> statement. On line 10, write the following code:</p>
  <p><code><strong>print(simile)</strong></code></p>
  <p>Now, when we hit <strong>Run</strong>, the program will print our simile, which is the formula that we taught it on line 9. Try hitting <strong>Run</strong> and seeing what happens! Then hit <a href="Simile_Generator_6.html"><strong>Next</strong></a>.</p>
