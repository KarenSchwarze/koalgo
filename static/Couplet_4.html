        <h1>Getting the Final Lines</h1>
        <p>Let's recap what we've done so far: We've imported Python's <code><strong>random</strong></code> module to allow our program to randomly choose values from our lists of rhyming words to create our couplet. We've created two variables, <code><strong>line_1_rhyming_words</strong></code> and <code><strong>line_2_rhyming_words</strong></code>, each containing a list of words. All of the words rhyme. Next, we created two more variables, <code><strong>line_1</strong></code> and <code><strong>line_2</strong></code>, and we are asking the user to provide the lines (all but the last word in each line) from the Prologue couplet as the values for these variables.</p>
        <p>We have all of the pieces we need for our couplet. Now we just have to somehow get two words and add them to our user input so that we have two complete lines for our couplet.</p>
        <p>Because we have imported the <code><strong>random</strong></code> module, we're now able to use it in our program. This module has a function called <code><strong>.choice()</strong></code> that we can use.  We can type <code><strong>random.choice()</strong></code>, put the name of a list in the parentheses, and then an item will randomly be chosen from that list.</p>
        <p>Let's see how this works. On lines 9 and 10 of your code editor, type: </p> 
        <p><code><strong>word = random.choice(line_1_rhyming_words)</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>print(word)</strong></code></p>

        <p>In the output area below (on the right), you should see one of the words from <code><strong>line_1_rhyming_words</strong></code>. The program randomly chose a word from that list, assigned it as the value of the variable <code><strong>word</strong></code>, and displayed it!</p>
        <p>Delete the code on lines 9 and 10. Now that you've seen how <code><strong>random.choice()</strong></code> works, let's use it in our program.</p>
        <p>We need to create two more variables. These variables are going to contain the final version of our couplet lines. We will call them <code><strong>line_1_final</strong></code> and <code><strong>line_2_final</strong></code>. Write this on lines 9 and 10 of your code editor: </p>
        <p><code><strong>line_1_final = </strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>line_2_final = </strong></code></p>
       
        <p>We know that we want to get the final version of each line of our couplet, but we need to teach the program what the formula is for each line. We will use <strong>concatenation</strong> to add together all of the pieces of each line of the couplet. <strong>Concatenation</strong> means "adding together". We do this using the + symbol, just as you do when adding in math class.</p>
        <p>Before we write the code, let's write it as a formula:</p>

        <p>line 1 of couplet = the user input we got for line 1 + a random word from our first list of words</p>
        <p>line 2 of couplet = the user input we got for line 2 + a random word from our second list of words</p>

        <p>We have variables and values to represent all of these pieces of our formula--let's put them together! Add this code to lines 9 and 10 of your code editor, after the = signs:</p>
        <p><code><strong>line_1 + random.choice(line_1_rhyming_words)</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>line_2 + random.choice(line_2_rhyming_words)</strong></code></p>
        <p>Now the final version of the first line of our couplet will "equal" the user input (represented by <code><strong>line_1</strong></code>) "plus" a random word from the first list of rhyming words. The final version of the second line of our couplet will "equal" the user input (represented by <code><strong>line_2</strong></code>) "plus" a random word from the second list of rhyming words.</p>
