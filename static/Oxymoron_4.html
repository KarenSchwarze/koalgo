        <h1>Indexing in Python</h1>
        <p>Now we're going to learn about indexing in Python. Indexing means that every value in a list has a number automatically assigned to it. For the first value in a list, that number is always 0. The second item in the list is 1, the third item in the list is 2, and so on.</p>
        <p>The cool thing about indexing is that, when a number is assigned to a value, you can do things with those numbers and, in turn, do things with the values.</p>
        <p>If we were to represent our lists of adjectives and nouns using their index numbers, our lists would look like this:</p>
        <p><code><strong>adjectives = [0,1,2,3]</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>nouns = [0,1,2,3]</strong></code></p>
        <p>The first word in our <code><strong>adjectives</strong></code> variable is "brawling". What do you think its index number is? If you guessed 0, you're right!</p>
        <p>The first word in our <code><strong>nouns</strong></code> variable is "love". What do you think its index number is? That's right--it's also 0. "Brawling" and "love" are at index number 0 in their respective lists.</p>
        <p>To "call" an item that corresponds to a given index number in a list, all we need to do is type the name of the list--the variable name--and put the index number next to it in brackets. So, if we want to "call" the word "brawling", and its index number is 0 in a list named "adjectives", our code would look like this:</p>
        <p>adjectives[0]</p>
        <p>If this is all we want to display as our output, we can invoke, or use, the <code><strong>print</strong></code>function. We can put whatever we want to display in parentheses, like this:</p>
        <p><code><strong>print(adjectives[0])</strong></code></p>
        <p>We can even assign <code><strong>adjectives[0]</strong></code>to its own variable, like this:</p>
        <p><code><strong>word = adjectives[0]</strong></code></p>
        <p>If you do this, then you can just print the name of the variable, <code><strong>word</strong></code>, to get the same results as if you had printed <code><strong>adjectives[0]</strong></code>.</p> Try it in the code editor below! Just as an experiment, so you can see how indexing works, type the following on lines 3 through 5 of your code editor. Delete it when you're finished and click <a href ="Oxymoron_5.html"><strong>Next</strong></a> to continue.</p>
        <p><code><strong>adjectives = ["brawling"]</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>word = adjectives[0]</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>print(word)</strong></code></p>
