    <h2>About Koalgo</h2>
    <p>Koalgo is built on code exploration. In Korean <em>keompyuteo kodeu</em> means "computer code" and <em>algo sip-eohaneun</em> means "inquisitive". As a brand Koalgo seeks to encourage people to be curious and experimental about how code applies to our lives, including our literary lives. Put together the Korean words for "computer code" and "inquisitive" and you have <em>Koalgo</em>. Koalgo runs on HTML5Up, Trinket, Visual Studio Code, and [hosting service].</p>
