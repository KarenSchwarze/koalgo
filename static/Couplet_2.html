        <h1>Creating Word Lists</h1>
        <p>First, we need to tell our program that we want to use Python's <code><strong>random</strong></code>module. This module will allow the program to randomly choose from the list of ryhming words we will give it so that it can add those words to our couplet. We need to "import", or bring in, the <code><strong>random</strong></code> module, so on line 1 of your code editor (the space on the left below), type:</p> <p><code><strong>import random</strong></code></p>
        <p>On line 3 and 4, we are going to make two lists of words. The first list will be the possible end words for the first line of our couplet (including the real end word of the line), and the second list will be the possible end words for the second line of our couplet (including the real end word of the line). Notice that all of the words rhyme. We want to make sure that whatever words the program chooses, we still have a legitimate couplet whose last words rhyme. However, we don't want the program to choose the same word to attach to the end of each line, which is why we need two separate lists.</p>
        <p>The names of our lists, <code><strong>line_1_rhyming_words</strong></code> and <code><strong>line_2_rhyming_words</strong></code>, are <strong>variables</strong>. The words in the list are <strong>values</strong>. Think of a variable as a box and a value as something you put inside the box. So, <code><strong>line_1_rhyming_words</strong></code> is a variable, and the words in the list are its values.</p>
        <p>On line 3, type:</p>
        <p><code><strong>line_1_rhyming_words = ["attend", "mend", "commend"]</strong></code></p>
        <p>On line 4, type:</p>
        <p><code><strong>line_2_rhyming_words = ["end", "suspend", "recommend"]</strong></code></p>
