    <h1>Similes from Literature</h1>
		<p>Here are a few similes you may have read:</p>
		<p>"The horse was strutting like a prizefighter." - Laura Hillenbrand</p>
		<p>"There is no frigate like a book / to take us lands away." - Emily Dickinson</p>
		<p>"What happens to a dream deferred? / Does it dry up / like a raisin in the sun?" - Langston Hughes</p>
		<p>"Character is like a tree and reputation its shadow." - Abraham Lincoln</p>
		<p>These may look familiar to you were in the simile generator that you saw on the previous page. But did you notice that in our simile generator, these similies were <em>scrambled?</em>  That's what you're going to do with your simile generator: You're going to take real similes and use them in your program to create new similes by scrambling them.</p>
		<p>Let's get started!</p>
		<p>First, invoke the Python <code><strong>random</strong></code> module by typing <code><strong>import random</strong></code> on Line 1 of the code editor (on your left). The <code><strong>random</strong></code> module  will allow our program to randomly choose items from our lists to make our similes, so we want to import, or bring it into, our program. Click <a href="Simile_Generator_3.html"><strong>Next</strong></a> when you're finished.</p>
