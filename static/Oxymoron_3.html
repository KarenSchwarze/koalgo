        <h1>Variables & Values</h1>
        <p>First, we're going to make two lists of variables. Think of a <strong>variable</strong> as a container. Inside that container is something called a <strong>value</strong>. </p>
        <p>In the oxymorons from <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, the first word is an adjective. For example, "loving" in "loving hate" is an adjective. The second word in these oxymorons is a noun. For example, "hate" in "loving hate" is a noun. We are going to create two variables. The first variable is going to be our list of adjectives (the first word in the oxymorons) and the second variable will be our list of nouns (the second word in the oxymorons).</p>
        <p>Write the following code on lines 1 and 2 of your code editor (on the left):</p>
        <p><code><strong>adjectives = ["brawling","loving","heavy","sweet"]</strong></code></p>
        <p><code><strong>nouns = ["love","hate","lightness","sorrow"]</strong></code></p>
