	<h2>About Koalgo</h2>
	<p>Koalgo's mission is to encourage students to play with language using code. In Korean <em>keompyuteo kodeu</em> means "computer code" and <em>algo sip-eohaneun geos</em> means "inquisitive". Put together parts of these Korean words and you have <em>Koalgo</em>â€”an example of the innovation you get when curiosity and computer science intersect. </p>
